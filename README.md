## Introduction

>**[Project is still a Work in Progress]**

This project visualizes data from the [RDW](https://www.rdw.nl/) to help the journalists from [de Volkskrant](https://www.volkskrant.nl/) with their next big scoop about _the cars in the city_ **focusing on how the Netherlands improve their electric transportation**.

Thus this project depends on the data from [opendata RDW](https://opendata.rdw.nl/). To understand what kind of data this organization delivers, please read the [wiki](https://github.com/dewarian/frontend-data/wiki) or visit their website.

To know more about my process through this project, please visit the [wiki](https://github.com/dewarian/frontend-data/wiki).
